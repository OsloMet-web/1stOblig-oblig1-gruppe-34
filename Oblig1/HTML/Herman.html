    <h2>Herman Nygaard</h2>
    <p>My old school was: Foss Upper Secondary School.<br>
        Foss was a pretty good school with many good qualities. <br>
        There were many people from different cultural backgrounds, from all over Oslo. <br>
        Our teachers seemed competent and had a passion for their subjects. <br>
        I appreciated being able to have both IT and entrepreneurship as courses while I went there.</p>
