    <h2>Jakob Buhs</h2>
    <p>I attended Wang videreg√•ende skole.<br>
        That is a school for athletes that want to combine sports and school in the best way possible.<br>
        Great alternative for many athletes because of the understanding teachers and them willing to adapt.<br>
        Classmates were form different sports and we made friends despite of out differences.<br>
