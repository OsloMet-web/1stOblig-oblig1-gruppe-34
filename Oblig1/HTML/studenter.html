        My old VGS used to paint the walls in the canteen every year.<br>
    It was a big and diversive school with many people from different backgrounds.<br>
    Our class also used to have a big inflateable gorilla as a class pet.

    <h2>Herman Nygaard</h2>
    <p>My old school was: Foss Upper Secondary School.<br>
        Foss was a pretty good school with many good qualities. <br>
        There were many people from different cultural backgrounds, from all over Oslo. <br>
        Our teachers seemed competent and had a passion for their subjects. <br>
        I appreciated being able to have both IT and entrepreneurship as courses while I went there.</p>

    <h2>Jakob Buhs</h2>
    <p>I attended Wang videreg√•ende skole.<br>
        That is a school for athletes that want to combine sports and school in the best way possible.<br>
        Great alternative for many athletes because of the understanding teachers and them willing to adapt.<br>
        Classmates were form different sports and we made friends despite of out differences.<br>
